<h4>How to view the source code of a web page in Chrome</h4>
In this example, I will demonstrate how to view Amazon's source code while searching for a hidden duck. Follow these steps below:
<ol>
  <li>Go to
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon's homepage</a>
  </li>
  <li>Right click on the page (or if you are using a Mac, ctrl + click)</li>
  <li>Select "inspect" at the bottom of the menu that appears</li>
  <li>You should open up to the elements panel.
    Scroll down through the HTML.
    You will find the meowing duck in green toward the bottom of the home page HTML.
    <br>Here is what it looks like:
      <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0ZySAgd1_Yr_NSomtBd_CjdfGXULefRyw4g&usqp=CAU"
          alt="Meowing Duck" class="center">
          <figcaption>"Meowing Duck"</figcaption>
        <figure>
  </li>
</ol>

<div>

<h4>Using Dev Tools, you can:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Change the color of your font or background</li>
    <li>Go to the console tab and look for/fix errors in your CSS</li>
    <li>Alter your layout so it can be compatible on different sized decives</li>
</ul>

<div>

<h4>Metaphor:</h4>
Using Dev Tools is like getting an X-Ray; you can see the structure of your bones
and identify what's broken, just as a web developer can use Dev Tools to identify errors in the HTML/CSS/Java Script.
However, this metaphor falls short in that in Dev Tools you can tinker with the site directly, but an X-Ray does not allow
a doctor to touch the bones directly. The doctor would have to do surgery (or let the bones heal on their own) to resolve the issue.
